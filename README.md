# Real-Time Traffic Prediction System Using GNNs

## Project Overview
**Introduction:**  
This project involves predicting traffic flow in a simulated road network using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). It leverages a machine learning model to analyze and predict traffic patterns in real-time, which could be beneficial for traffic management and planning.

**Objective:**  
To develop a system that can predict traffic flow in real-time based on historical traffic data using advanced graph-based neural networks.

## Key Concepts and Technologies
**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):**  
Explain that GNNs are a class of neural networks designed to handle data represented as graphs. They are particularly useful for problems where relationships between entities (nodes) are important.

**Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs):**  
A type of GNN that applies convolution operations on graphs, similar to how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) apply convolutions to images. GCNs are effective in capturing the spatial structure of graph data.

**Libraries and Tools:**  
- PyTorch Geometric: A library for implementing GNNs using PyTorch.
- NetworkX: Used for creating and manipulating complex networks/graphs.
- NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For visualization.

## Project Structure
**Data Generation:**  
Simulate traffic data on a grid-based road network using NetworkX. Each node represents an intersection, and edges represent roads.

**Model Implementation:**  
Develop a Spatio-Temporal GCN model:
- Spatial Component: Use GCN layers to capture spatial dependencies in the traffic data.
- Temporal Component: Use an LSTM layer to capture temporal dependencies in the traffic data.
- Output: Predict traffic flow for the next few time steps based on historical data.

**Training the Model:**  
Train the model on simulated traffic data using PyTorch. Define a loss function (MSE) and an optimizer (Adam) to train the model over multiple epochs.

**Real-Time Prediction:**  
Simulate real-time traffic prediction by continuously updating the model with new traffic data and making predictions for future traffic flow.

## Code Explanation
**Create the Road Network:**
```python
import networkx as nx

def create_road_network():
    G = nx.grid_2d_graph(5, 5)  # Create a 5x5 grid graph
    G = nx.convert_node_labels_to_integers(G)  # Convert node labels to integers
    return G
